# Package Delivery Routing & Optimization

An algorithmic solution to the Traveling Salesperson Problem using a Greedy Heuristic to optimize delivery routes under 140 miles.

## Key Features
* **Custom Hash Table:** Built from scratch to achieve $O(1)$ average-case lookup for efficient package data retrieval.
* **Greedy Algorithm:** Nearest Neighbor logic for dynamic route optimization.
* **Real-Time Tracking:** Console interface for package status and mileage reporting.

* **Improvements Identified** Automating truck-loading via a priority measure would be the next step to improve system flexibility.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Data:** CSV Parsing (Standard Library)
* **Logic:** Algorithmic Heuristics, Data Structures
